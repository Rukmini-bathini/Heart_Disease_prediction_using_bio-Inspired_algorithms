ABSTRACT
Heart-related diseases or Cardio Vascular Diseases (CVDs) are the main reason for a huge number of death in the world over the last few decades and has emerged as the most life-threatening disease, not only in India but in the whole world.
So, there is a need of a reliable, accurate, and feasible system to diagnose such diseases in time for proper treatment.
Machine Learning algorithms and techniques have been applied to various medical datasets to automate the analysis of large and complex data.
In recent times, many researchers have been using several machine learning techniques to help the healthcare industry and professionals diagnose heart-related diseases.
This paper surveys various models based on such algorithms and techniques and analyzes their performance. Models based on supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) and Deep Learning based Bio-Inspired Algorithms such as Genetic Selection CV, BAT, ABC(BEE) and ensemble models are found very popular among the researchers.
